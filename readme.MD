
Food Chain for MINETEST

Derived from an older version of TenPlus1's Mobs Redo.


This mod experiments with creating a food chain between mobs.  They have hunger and will mate when times are good or will starve when times are bad.  Some animals are herbivors, some omnivors, other are preditors with the spider being the apex preditor.


This mod is experimental and does not have a public anouncement on the Minetest forums.


Crafts:

 - Nametag (paper, black dye, string) can be used right-click on a tamed mob to give them a name.
 - Nets can be used to right-click tamed mobs to pick them up and place inside inventory as a spawn egg.
 - Magic Lasso is similar to nets but with a better chance of picking up larger mobs.
 - Shears are used to right-click sheep and return 1-3 wool.
